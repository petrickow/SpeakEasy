# SpeakEasy
Messing about with spring, spring data, websockets and mongodb. The intention is to create a web-chat application
just for fun while learning some new front end tricks and re-familiarize myself with Spring.

## Setup
Project has been created using IntelliJ's Spring Boot template, which defaults to Maven for package handling.

Use the appropriate _mvnw_ script to set up the project via the commandline (came with the template, not tested).
